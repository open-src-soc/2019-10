<h2 id="what-does-the-space-industry-expect-from-risc-v">What does the space industry expect from RISC-V?</h2>
<p>By <a href>Antoine Certain</a>(<a href>Airbus Defence &amp; Space</a>)</p>
<p>The space industry has some particularities which makes the usage of COTS components quite difficult. But, with the emergence of new space designs based on COTS, the space industry open its doors to a bigger ecosystem. And the RISC V ecosystem could answer to the major requirements of spacecraft design. This presentation will present the main requirements such industry expect from a core IP.</p>
<p>*Antoine CERTAIN is an experienced hardware and software architect on embedded data-handling applications on spacecraft. He has gained large scale of space knowledge thanks to several projects for ESA, CNES and internally to Airbus Defence and Space. He is now team leader of the R&amp;D On board data processing team of Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse, FR.</p>

<p>By <a href>Jan Andersson</a>(<a href="https://www.gaisler.com">Cobham Gaisler</a>)</p>
<p>Cobham Gaisler is a world leader for space computing solutions where the company provides radiation tolerant system-on-chip devices based around the LEON processors. The building blocks for these devices are also available as IP cores from the company in an IP library named GRLIB. Cobham Gaisler is currently developing a RV64GC core that will be provided as part of GRLIB. The presentation will cover features of the IP core and how it fits with existing peripherals, with technical items we see missing in the specification.</p>
<p>*Mr Jan Andersson is working at Cobham Gaisler as Director of Engineering, overseeing hardware and software development efforts. Its key competencies are in management of projects developing complex digital systems, microprocessor architecture, fault-tolerance concepts, use of programmable logic, Field Programmable Gate Arrays for applications both in consumer electronics and harsh environments. He holds a Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering focused on digital design and embedded systems.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/michael-chapman-at-cortus">Michael Chapman</a>(<a href="https://www.cortus.com">Cortus</a>)</p>
<p>Cortus is a French ASIC design company with a very large selection of IPs available including processors (Cortus proprietary ISA, RISC-V ISA), and many other Digital, Analog/RF and Security (HW &amp; SW) which together with its ASIC Design expertise enables it to architect, design and implement innovative chips for its clients.</p>
<p>Cortus provides a comprehensive and complete toolchain package such as debugger, compiler, IDE, etc, for all the chips it develops.</p>
<p>To facilitate the work of software developers, Cortus can also provide FPGA prototypes.</p>
<p>Cortus has designed and is designing chips and modules for customers incorporating RISC-V processors in the following application fields: Satellite, Avionics, Automotive, IoT, Hardware Security Module, HPC (outside Europe)</p>
<p>*Michael Chapman is the creator of microprocessors, micro-controllers, CAN (Controller Area Network) and System C.</p>
<p>He has worked on a Silicon on Saphire radiation hard microprocessor chip set for Marconi Space and Defence, a pure asynchronous chip for Acorn computers, and developed all the initial CAN implementations including the Intel 82526 and those for Bosch internal implementations, Philips, Motorola, National, NEC, Siemens as well as the Intel 82527 and those on Intel MCUs. He also developed MCUs for engine management and ABS.</p>
<p>He designed a new generation 16 bit micro-controller for Siemens and modeled that controller in ‘C’. The simulation environment he created escaped from Siemens and became the foundation of System C.</p>
<p>In 2003, he created the first Cortus processor which is at the heart of security solutions used in bank cards, SIM cards, e-passport and is the root of trust in many devices including Blackberry, Intel, Fujitsu, etc.</p>
<h2 id="achieving-determinism-and-performance-on-the-risc-v-flexpret-processor">Achieving determinism and performance on the RISC-V FlexPRET Processor</h2>
<p>By <a href>Eric Jenn</a>(<a href="http://www.irt-saintexupery.com/">IRT Saint-Exupéry</a>)</p>
<p>Performance improvement usually comes at the cost of temporal determinism. Trading better average performance for a loss of predictability is sometimes acceptable, but it is not for safety-critical applications where the time at which a value is produced is often as important as the value itself. In this talk, we address the question of temporal determinism, which is a prerequisite to dependability. We show how we combine a deterministic programming model with a deterministic hardware architecture and an “holistic” optimization process to achieve both performance and dependability. This work is applied on the MultiPRET processor, a “multicore” declination of the RiscV FlexPRET PREcision Timed Architecture (PRET) proposed by the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
<p>*Dr Eric Jenn is a research engineer at Thales AVS. He is currently managing the Critical Applications on Predictable High-Performance Computing Architectures (CAPHCA) collaborative research project at IRT Saint-Exupéry in Toulouse. Dr Jenn has been working in the area of safety critical systems for around 30 years, both on the analysis and development of nuclear and avionics systems. His interests cover all aspects of the development of dependable real-time systems, including certification, system modeling and design, real-time software development, formal verification, and microarchitecture design. He has participated in many collaborative research projects involving academic and industrial partners, including GUARDS, Diana, SPICES, ESPASS, P, etc.</p>
<h2 id="risc-v-based-virtual-prototype-an-open-source-platform-for-modeling-and-verification">RISC-V based Virtual Prototype: An Open Source Platform for Modeling and Verification</h2>
<p>By <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~grosse/">Daniel Große</a>(<a href="https://www.uni-bremen.de">University of Bremen</a> and <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/">DFKI GmbH</a>)</p>
<p>We propose an open source RISC-V based Virtual Prototype (VP) under MIT license, available at <a href="http://www.systemc-verification.org/riscv-vp" class="uri">http://www.systemc-verification.org/riscv-vp</a>. Our VP is implemented in standard compliant SystemC using a generic bus system with TLM 2.0 communication. Our VP provides a 32 and 64 bit RISC-V core with different privilege levels, the RISC-V CLINT and PLIC interrupt controllers and an essential set of peripherals. It supports simulation of (mixed 32 and 64 bit) multi-core platforms and provides SW debug and coverage measurement capabilities. We support FreeRTOS, Zephyr and Linux operating systems. Our VP allows a significantly faster simulation compared to RTL, while being more accurate than existing ISSs. The VP has been designed as configurable and extensible platform. For example we provide the configuration for the RISC-V HiFive1 board from SiFive.</p>
<p>*Daniel Große is a Senior Researcher at the University of Bremen and the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) Bremen, Germany. His research interests include verification, virtual prototyping, debugging and synthesis. He has published more than 120 papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences and served in program committees of numerous conferences, such as DAC, ICCAD, DATE and CODES+ISSS. He received best paper awards at FDL 2007, DVCon Europe 2018, and ICCAD 2018.</p>
