<h2 id="its-the-instruction-fetch-front-end-stupid">It’s the Instruction Fetch Front-End, Stupid!</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://team.inria.fr/pacap/members/andre-seznec">André Seznec</a> (<a href="https://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a>).</p>
<p>Achieving high single-thread performance remains a major challenge even in the multicore era. To achieve ultimate single-thread performance, a uniprocessor needs a very efficient memory hierarchy, an aggressive out-of-order execution core and a highly efficient instruction fetch front-end engine.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will focus on the challenges for the design of the instruction fetch frond-end in a very wide-issue processor.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.ict.tuwien.ac.at/staff/taherinejad">Nima Taherinejad</a> (<a href="https://www.ict.tuwien.ac.at">TU Wien</a>).</p>
<p>In this talk, first, I briefly review existing open source GPUs and their status. Given its merit and the work we have done in group on the award-winning Nyuzi GPGPU, I will pay a closer attention to that work. Next, I will discuss some of the challenges they face as well as the importance of investing more into research and development of such architectures and potential direction of such research and development. At the end, I position RISC-V with respect to the open source GPUs and present some ideas on how RISC-V and its community can play a role in a potentially joint future.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/deschips">Fabien Chouteau</a> (<a href="https://www.adacore.com">Ada Core</a>).</p>
<p>In this talk I want to open a window into the wonderful world of “alternative” programming languages for RISC-V. What can you get by looking beyond C/C++.</p>
<p>So I will start with a quick introduction to the Ada and SPARK languages, the benefits, the hurdles. I will also present an overview of the applications and domains where they shine, when failure is not an option.</p>
<p>At the end of the talk, I will give my view of the RISC-V architecture and community from the perspective of an alternative languages developer. I will cover the good points, the risks, and provide some ideas on how the RISC-V can keep the door open.</p>

<h2 id="risc-v-isa-secure-ics-trojan-horse-to-conquer-security">RISC-V ISA: Secure-IC’s Trojan Horse to Conquer Security</h2>
<p>By Rafail Psiakis &amp; <a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/guilley">Sylvain Guilley</a> (<a href="http://www.secure-ic.com">Secure IC</a>).</p>
<p>RISC-V is an emerging instruction-set architecture widely used inside plenty of modern embedded SoCs. As the number of commercial vendors adopting this architecture in their products increases, security becomes a priority. In Secure-IC we use RISC-V implementations in many of our products (e.g. PULPino in Securyzr HSM, PicoSoC in Cyber Escort Unit, etc.). The advantage is that they are natively protected against a lot of modern vulnerability exploits (e.g. Specter, Meltdow, ZombieLoad and so on) due to the simplicity of their architecture. For the rest of the vulnerability exploits, Secure-IC crypto-IPs have been implemented around the cores to ensure the authenticity and the confidentiality of the executed code. Due to the fact that RISCV ISA is open-source, new verification methods can be proposed and evaluated both at the architectural and the micro-architectural level. Secure-IC with its solution named Cyber Escort Unit, verifies the control flow of the code executed on a PicoRV32 core of the PicoSoC system. The community also uses the open-source RISC-V ISA in order to evaluate and test new attacks. In Secure-IC, RISC-V allows us to penetrate into the architecture itself and test new attacks (e.g. sidechannel attacks, Trojan injection, etc.) making it our Trojan horse to conquer security.</p>
<h2 id="a-risc-v-isa-extension-for-ultra-low-power-iot-wireless-signal-processing">A RISC-V ISA Extension for Ultra-Low Power IoT Wireless Signal Processing</h2>
<p>By Hela Belhadj Amor, <strong>Carolynn Bernier</strong> (<a href="http://www.leti-cea.fr">CEA LETI</a>), Zdeněk Přikryl (<a href="http://www.codasip.com">Codasip GmbH</a>).</p>
<p>We present an instruction-set extension to the open-source RISC-V ISA (RV32IM) dedicated to ultra-low power (ULP) software-defined wireless IoT transceivers. The custom instructions are tailored to the needs of 8/16/32-bit integer complex arithmetic typically required by quadrature modulations. The proposed extension occupies only 3 major opcodes and most instructions are designed to come at a near-zero hardware and energy cost. A functional model of the new architecture is used to evaluate four IoT baseband processing test benches: FSK demodulation, LoRa preamble detection, 32-bit FFT and CORDIC algorithm. Results show an average energy efficiency improvement of more than 35% with up to 50% obtained for the LoRa preamble detection algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="an-out-of-order-riscv-core-developed-with-hls">An Out-of-Order RISCV Core Developed with HLS</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://perso.univ-perp.fr/bernard.goossens/">Bernard Goossens</a></strong> &amp; David Parello (<a href="https://webdali.univ-perp.fr">UPVD</a>).</p>
<p>I will introduce the out-of-order RISC-V core (4-stage pipeline: fetch + decode + rename; issue; writeback; commit) that we developed. Everything is written entirely in C under Vivado HLS. The code has been successfully tested on a Pynq card (free development board provided to teacher-researchers upon request to Xilinx, as part of the XUP initiative). This RISC-V core should be understood as a basic kit on which users are invited to add extensions. The RISC-V core does not contain any traditional accelerator for filling the pipeline (eg branch predictor, caches) or floating operators (only the set of 32-bit integer instructions has been implemented). It can serve as a nutshell to add units and measure their effects, for example in the context of educational projects. This RISC-V core is the core brick of the LBP processor, a 64-cores manycore parallelizing processor, under development.</p>

<p>Nanvix est un système d’exploitation généraliste conçu et développé pour les nouvelles générations de processeurs many-cœurs. Un effort important a été mené pour rendre le système Nanvix portable et performant sur une grande variété de processeurs, comme le MPPA (Kalray) ou des processeurs à base OpenRisc (OptimSoC) ou bien RISC-V (PULP). La portabilité de Nanvix est garantie par la couche d’abstraction HAL que nous présenterons pendant cet exposé. Une des particularités des architectures est que les cœurs sont regroupées en clusters avec un espace de mémoire local réduit. Une des originalités de Nanvix est de proposer une gestion de mémoire paginée et distribuée sur le processeur et la mémoire centrale. Les services de base du système Nanvix sont pris en charge par des processus serveurs spécialisés, qui s’exécutent en mode utilisateur. Le domaine applicatif visé par Nanvix est celui des data centers. Nanvix Website: <a href="https://github.com/nanvix"><code>https://github.com/nanvix</code></a></p>
<h2 id="fast-and-accurate-vulnerability-analysis-of-a-risc-v-processor">Fast and Accurate Vulnerability Analysis of a RISC-V Processor</h2>
<p>By Joseph Paturel, Simon Rokicki, Davide Pala, <strong><a href="http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Olivier.Sentieys/">Olivier Sentieys</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a>).</p>
<p>As the RISC-V ISA gains traction in the safety-critical embedded system domain, the development of hardened cores becomes crucial. During this presentation, we present a vulnerability analysis framework that allows for a fast and accurate estimation of processor errors due to transient faults. The proposed set of tools is based on the 32-bit RISC-V core Comet supporting the M extension. The generated hardware’s reaction to particle hits is characterized at the gate-level using logic transient pulse width based on physical transistor models. The Comet core being designed at the C level with high-level synthesis tools, a fast, cycle- and bit-accurate simulator can be derived from the core specifications. The previously extracted error patterns are hence re-injected in the core during the execution of applications and the system response is evaluated. This enables the estimation of various vulnerability related metrics and can swiftly drive the core-hardening design process. Results show that the combinational logic needed to implement the M extension plays a non-negligible role in the overall core vulnerability and that multiple-bit upset patterns need to be considered.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-to-adoption-of-open-source-risc-v-processors">Challenges to Adoption of Open-Source RISC-V Processors</h2>
<p>By <strong>Zdeněk Přikryl</strong> &amp; Chris Jones (<a href="http://www.codasip.com">Codasip GmbH</a>).</p>
<p>The RISC-V movement offers the greatest potential for innovation in SoC design in a decade as a global ecosystem of contributors has emerged. This movement offers unprecedented choice for both research and for commercial consumers of processor technology. However, going from open source RISC-V implementation to deployment in a real production design requires cooperation of commercial IP and tools suppliers. Codasip endeavours to bridge the gap between open source and proprietary ISAs by offering professional grade RISC-V implementations and development tools for end-users to modify and optimize the architecture. This presentation will discuss many of the challenges of commercial use of RISC-V and Codasip’s approach to addressing them in a manner that benefits the entire RISC-V community.</p>
