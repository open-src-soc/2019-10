<p>By <a href>Antoine Certain</a>(<a href>Airbus Defence &amp; Space</a>)</p>
<p>The space industry has some particularities which makes the usage of COTS components quite difficult. But, with the emergence of new space designs based on COTS, the space industry open its doors to a bigger ecosystem. And the RISC V ecosystem could answer to the major requirements of spacecraft design. This presentation will present the main requirements such industry expect from a core IP.</p>
<p>*Antoine CERTAIN is an experienced hardware and software architect on embedded data-handling applications on spacecraft. He has gained large scale of space knowledge thanks to several projects for ESA, CNES and internally to Airbus Defence and Space. He is now team leader of the R&amp;D On board data processing team of Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse, FR.</p>

<p>By <a href>Jan Andersson</a>(<a href="https://www.gaisler.com">Cobham Gaisler</a>)</p>
<p>Cobham Gaisler is a world leader for space computing solutions where the company provides radiation tolerant system-on-chip devices based around the LEON processors. The building blocks for these devices are also available as IP cores from the company in an IP library named GRLIB. Cobham Gaisler is currently developing a RV64GC core that will be provided as part of GRLIB. The presentation will cover features of the IP core and how it fits with existing peripherals, with technical items we see missing in the specification.</p>
<p>*Mr Jan Andersson is working at Cobham Gaisler as Director of Engineering, overseeing hardware and software development efforts. Its key competencies are in management of projects developing complex digital systems, microprocessor architecture, fault-tolerance concepts, use of programmable logic, Field Programmable Gate Arrays for applications both in consumer electronics and harsh environments. He holds a Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering focused on digital design and embedded systems.</p>

<h2>Achieving determinism and performance on the RISC-V FlexPRET</h2>
<p>Processor</p>
<p>By <a href>Eric Jenn</a>(<a href="http://www.irt-saintexupery.com/">IRT Saint-Exupéry</a>)</p>
<p>Performance improvement usually comes at the cost of temporal determinism. Trading better average performance for a loss of predictability is sometimes acceptable, but it is not for safety-critical applications where the time at which a value is produced is often as important as the value itself. In this talk, we address the question of temporal determinism, which is a prerequisite to dependability. We show how we combine a deterministic programming model with a deterministic hardware architecture and an “holistic” optimization process to achieve both performance and dependability. This work is applied on the MultiPRET processor, a &quot;multicore&quot; declination of the RiscV FlexPRET PREcision Timed Architecture (PRET) proposed by the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
<p>*Dr Eric Jenn is a research engineer at Thales AVS. He is currently managing the Critical Applications on Predictable High-Performance Computing Architectures (CAPHCA) collaborative research project at IRT Saint-Exupéry in Toulouse. Dr Jenn has been working in the area of safety critical systems for around 30 years, both on the analysis and development of nuclear and avionics systems. His interests cover all aspects of the development of dependable real-time systems, including certification, system modeling and design, real-time software development, formal verification, and microarchitecture design. He has participated in many collaborative research projects involving academic and industrial partners, including GUARDS, Diana, SPICES, ESPASS, P, etc.</p>
